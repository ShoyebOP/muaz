# Initial Concept

This is a professional book selling site. It features a main landing page and a dedicated preview page with a horizontal carousel to showcase book content. It includes an order button that opens a popup for customer details (name, phone, address) with 11-digit phone number validation, and displays a billing summary with the book price and delivery charge. Upon confirmation, customer details are sent to a Telegram chat group. The project is hosted on Vercel and integrated with GitHub.
